Draw It or Lose It Requirements

## Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client is a software company named The Gaming Room.  We were taksed with desiging an online game called "Draw It or Lose It" that is similar to the classing games "Win Lose or Draw".

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I belive I did a very good job breaking down user requirements, describing their options and, making solid recomendations.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I find the functional decomposition associated with building a solid design document helps with defining and limiting the scope of what needs to be coded.  Additioanlly, I find that design documents can be used as a guide for writing meaningful tests.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The only thing I think I'd revise on this document would be the discussion of runtime client / platforms.  This is because the actual clients are web-browsers.  I would improve this by exploring the requirements and runtime behavior of browser-based web apps an how the screen size and device type affect the design.  

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interperted the user's need as a responsive and lightweight website for having a fun casual experiance with their friends.  I incorporated this into the design by considering the simplest and least 'expensive' method of delivering this experiance. 

One should always consider the user's need when designing software.  This is because a user satisified with the software will actually use it.  This can also lead to reccomendations and positive result for our clients.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I began designing the software by breaking down the requirements in to user stories and then considering architecture patterns that could provide these features with minimal friction and costs.

In future projects I would use a similar approach.  I'd read and interpert the client's requirements with the end-users experiance in mind. Once I understand the requirements, I'd start designing the software with the client's constraints in mind.
